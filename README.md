# NEAT-bot
Unassisted game playing bot using NEAT.

It is a neuro-evolutionary game playing bot which learns to fly by itself. It starts off flying randomly. The fitness of a bot depends on number of pipes it crosses without colliding. The bot gets better and better with every new generation as it realises what to do and what not to do from its experience of previous generations. 

This project was a part of the CS561 Artificial Intelligence course at IIT Guwahati.
